Python file dump

Future ideas:
Quick ping TraceRT for local IPs in local IP Scope
MX to different DNS servers to see the different IPs returned


New year resolution. Get into Python

At some point I will put all of my scripts into here but they're all over the place at the moment.


Debug.Py = Grabs some info from the machine it is running on, useful to quickly get machine info.
Discord.Py = Old Discord bot, needs updating with current code. Good base for someone new tho.
Ping.Py = Multi-OS-compatible ping script
QuickPingResolver.Py = gets IP and if it is alive
ScrapeABPData.Py = Made to scrape ABP data for email addresses for marketing
ServerBoot.Py = Triggers on boot from Task Scheduler, sends a notif with basic info to tell me reboot happened
